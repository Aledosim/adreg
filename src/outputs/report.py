report_description = """
This command will print the report of AdReg. It reads the file at the root directory of the application. You can filter
the report on client name or period of time.
All parameters are filters. CLIENT is the name of the client, START is the starting date of the report and END is the
ending date. END defaults to the current day, so you can use it without supply the value.
